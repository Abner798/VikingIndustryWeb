            <h1>Executives</h1>
            <p>Our organization has three executives who ensure the team and company runs effectively and efficiently. Our organization’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is Kaitlin Healey. This is her third year with Viking Industries. Kaitlin is an experienced researcher developer, having experience with robotics for the past five years. Kaitlin’s greatest motivation to be part of Viking Industries is to obtain experience teaching leading a team of diverse individuals and to show others that even in a male dominated field, you don’t have to be a man to shine through.  She oversaw manufacturing, wiring and coding.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Viking Industries’ Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is Tanish Bhatt, who oversaw the Finances, 3D-Printing, and Marketing departments. Tanish has been with Viking Industries for two years now, serving as the interim CEO in 2021-22. Tanish’s greatest motivation to be part of Viking Industries robotics program is due to the real-world experience that can be obtained through such a robotics program, and the wide array of opportunities to develop new skills and meet like-minded individuals. </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h1>Manufacturing</h1>
            <p>Our manufacturing team includes Brendan Booth, Keegan Riggs, Ahmad Saady, and Emma Penney. This group was responsible for the major production and development of the robot. They assembled the frame of the robot from aluminum and with 3-D printed joint connectors. This year, the manufacturing team’s primary focus was the construction of a watertight container to store our electronics.</p>

            <p>Our Finance and Marketing Teams consisted of Svea MacKenzie, Samiran Chauhan, Adhira Ganesh, and Orpa Hawladar. The finance team was in charge of effectively keeping track of our spending and investments, providing resources our production departments needed and making sure we stayed on budget. As well, our Finance Team developed projections as to our organization’s financial stability and entrepreneurial statistics.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Our marketing teams managed public relations, advertised our company to the greater community, and developed fundraisers. They also took the initiative for outreach to other companies for potential grants, sponsorships and any other forms of support for our company.</p>

            <p>Our wiring team has been heavily invested in researching and developing the robot’s electronics. They have spent time developing the robot’s many functional systems while taking power limits and safety into consideration. The wiring team plans on utilizing a Raspberry Pi and Arduino system to include the motors, tools, cameras, and control system. Members of this group include Brendan Booth, Dipayan Dhar, and Chizurum Azu-Emuchay.</p>

            <h1>3D-Printing</h1>
            <p>3D Printing - one of the latest and well-renowned form of development and innovation. Viking Industries is proud to have our very own 3D Printing department, which was responsible for designing and printing the components of our robot.This year we used a Eryone ER-20 generously donated to us by PolyUnity. We used the printer to create joints to connect aluminum pieces we used, which allowed us to achieve high levels of precision on the joint angles. We also used it to print parts of our tool because of how it can easily print high complexity and precise parts that would be extremely difficult to fabricate by hand. Our 3-D printing team consisted of Brendan Booth, Samiran Chauhan, Orpa Hawlader, and Emma Penney.</p>

            <p>The coding team has been working on programming the Arduino and Raspberry Pi microcontrollers for the robot. The robot was programmed with Python and the Arduino framework, which is based on C++. This team has created the control system for the robot, managing motor speeds, servo movement, and gathering data from sensors. We have designed the control system in order for the pilot to effectively maneuver the robot and utilize its functions. Members of the coding team included Dipayan Dhar, Abner Zhang, Shalom Alemu, and Riley Skanes.</p>
